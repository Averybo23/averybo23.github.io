<p> So many people have different opinions on serum. Whether it does anything, does it cause acne, can it clog pores, what qualifies as a serum? Well from what I have experienced people with acne should use different exfoliant acids. Glycolic Acid is great for unclogging pores, and after any extraction or breakout, I love to put it on. I have never tried Azelic Acid serum or even Salicylic acid serum, but some of my friends say that these work well for them and they love it. Similar to the toner my skin specialist gave me her brand so there is no brand to shop from. However, after doing some research found these similar products.</p>
