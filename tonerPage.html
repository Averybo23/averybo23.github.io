 <center><h1>Toner</h1></center>
<p> The next step is toner! Some people say it's optional, I visited a skin specialist and she said that not only is it important but if you have the right one it can help prevent acne. She gave me a toner made from Calendula extract. Because it was from her brand which is not in stores I found the next best one. I would also like to say that depending on your acne type toner might not be the best option.</p>
